# AtlyssTools

A set of tools to help with Atlyss modding.
Currently a WIP, but should function as intended. Report any bugs via the channels provided in the support section.

Allows for the following:

- Loading scriptable objects from JSON files into the game cache.
- Automatically load assetbundles into AtlyssTools, and automatically load supported assets from them.
- Add new commands to the game, allowing for more interactivity with mods.
- Load asset only mods, which only require assets to be loaded, instead of code mods.

## Installation

This expects you have BepInEx installed. If you don't, you can find
it [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).

Please use BepInEx 5.4.23.

To install AtlyssTools manually, simply download the latest release from the releases page and extract it into your BepInEx
plugins folder in ``BepinEx/plugins``. 
You may also use r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager to install it.
